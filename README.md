# 🔗 Dulio Shortener

Dulio Shortener is a small full-stack application for creating and managing
short URLs. Users create an account, sign in, save links, and share compact URLs
that redirect visitors to the original destination.

The project contains a Go API built with Echo and SQLite, plus a React and
TypeScript frontend built with Vite.

## ✨ What it does

- Creates accounts using a username, optional display name, and password.
- Authenticates users and keeps their links private to their account.
- Creates, lists, and deletes short links.
- Redirects public short URLs without loading the frontend.
- Limits each account to 50 links and rejects duplicate destinations.

Implementation and design details are documented in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🧰 Requirements

For the container-based workflow:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

For native development:

- Go 1.27.2 or newer
- A C compiler available on `PATH`, required by `go-sqlite3`
- Node.js 20.19.x or 22.12 or newer, plus npm

## 🏗️ How to build

Build the API and migration container images from the repository root:

```sh
docker compose build api migrate
```

Compile all Go packages natively:

```sh
go build ./...
```

Install the locked frontend dependencies and create a production build:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
```

The frontend build is written to `frontend/dist`.

## 🚀 How to run

### 1️⃣ Configure the project

Copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Review `.env` before starting. On Linux, `DULIO_UID` and `DULIO_GID` must
match the user that owns the `data` directory.

### 2️⃣ Add the TLS certificate

Create `data/tls` and place the certificate files expected by the API there:

```text
data/
└── tls/
    ├── origin.pem
    └── origin.key
```

The configured container user must be able to read both files and write to the
`data` directory.

### 3️⃣ Apply the database migrations

Run migrations independently before starting the API:

```sh
docker compose run --rm migrate up
```

Useful migration commands include:

```sh
docker compose run --rm migrate status
docker compose run --rm migrate version
docker compose run --rm migrate down
```

`down` rolls back one migration and should be used intentionally. The API never
applies migrations automatically.

### 4️⃣ Start the API

```sh
docker compose up --build -d api
```

View its logs or stop it with:

```sh
docker compose logs -f api
docker compose down
```

The API uses the host port configured by `DULIO_HTTP_PORT`, which defaults to
`443`.

### 5️⃣ Start the frontend

The frontend is not part of the Compose file. Start its development server in a
separate terminal:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local development URL after it starts.

## 🗃️ Native migrations

To run the migration tool without Docker in a POSIX shell:

```sh
DATABASE_PATH=./data/dulio.db go run ./database/cmd/migrate up
```

In PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_PATH = ".\data\dulio.db"
go run ./database/cmd/migrate up
```

Replace `up` with `status`, `version`, or `down` when needed.

## 🧪 Verification

Run the backend checks from the repository root:

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
```

Run the frontend checks from `frontend`:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## ☁️ Deployment note

This project currently runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), but the
repository does not include a Terraform module or a complete cloud deployment
guide.

The steps above describe the project itself. Production deployment may differ
because OCI setup, cloud networking, Cloudflare integration, DNS routing, and
TLS certificate provisioning add environment-specific layers that cannot be
fully addressed by this README.
